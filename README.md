# College-Projects
Hello again! 

Welcome to the documentation of the start of my programming journey!
This is a special place for me and I'm hapy to share my work with you.


I started coding in R for a ecology and stats course in college. We used R to run tests on the data we collected for the different projects that happened in class. Here I was kind of on the fence about whether I actually liked programming or not. To be honest, I actually kind of found it really annoying and thought of it more as something I needed to learn to pass the course. I did the work and thats it. The first thing that kind of changed that mindset was this really annoying final assignment in that course. I used to be able to figure out the bare minimum to get the rudimentry code I wrote to work and give me what results I needed. I remember putting in some work to learn the syntax for most basic graphing and stats functions that R has to offer. I did this so I didnt have to repeatedly work on fixing mistakes in the code or whatever just so I could finish quickly and be done with it. Towards the second half I started finishing faster than some of my friends and they kept asking me for help. That made me kinda happy but I sure as day wasn't good at it, just better in comparison. Then came the day where I started working on that final assignment. I remember reading one of the hardest questions on the assignment and thinking i have no idea how to do this. While I worked on it I remember writing about 16 lines of code for the question and thinking this is definetly so wrong. I thought lets try and run this and see what happens. I hit run. IT RAN WITHOUT A SINGLE ERROR! At that moment I knew it was definetly not correct but at least it ran. It gave me this weird skewed bell curve and thats it. I had no idea what it meant. I spent 5 minutes writing the code but probably like and hour or two trying to understand what it did. I remember going to a friend who was actually good at programming and asking him to explain what the code I wrote did. 

Well I think I found that experience fun and here I am, documenting my code. I did a few more projects after that, but they were mostly in Python and not R.

Anyways,
Have Fun and a Great Day!
